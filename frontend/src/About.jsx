        Welcome to our website dedicated to security cam criminal detection! We
        are a team of passionate final year Computer Science and Engineering
        (CSE) students from the University of Engineering & Management (UEM)
        Kolkata. Our project, developed during the academic year 2023-2024, aims
        to tackle the pressing real-life issue of increasing crime rates through
        innovative technological solutions. Driven by our collective commitment
        to making a positive impact, we embarked on this journey to harness the
        power of computer vision and machine learning to enhance security
        measures. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we have developed a
        robust system capable of detecting and identifying potential criminals
        captured by security cameras in various settings. Our project not only
        represents the culmination of years of rigorous academic training but
        also embodies our dedication to applying our skills to address
        real-world challenges. By leveraging our expertise in CSE, we are proud
        to contribute to the safety and security of our communities. At the
        heart of our endeavor lies a deep-rooted belief in the transformative
        potential of technology to create safer environments for all. We are
        excited to share our project with you and invite you to explore how our
        innovative solution can make a difference in enhancing security
        measures. Thank you for visiting our website and for your interest in
        our project. Together, let's build a safer tomorrow.
